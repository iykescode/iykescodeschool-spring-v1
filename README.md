# IykescodeSchool Web App

## Overview

This is a school web app system that fully built on Springboot as backend and Thymeleaf as a frontend engine.

### The Challenge

### Install and Run

- Open up the project in any IDE of your choice (Make sure you have required extensions to run springboot and thymeleaf projects on your IDE)
- Required dependencies are in `pom.xml`
- Configure mongodb details in `application.properties`
- Run iykescodeschool_schema.sql and iykescodeschool_data.sql to update Mongo database
- Click `build` to build the project and install all dependencies and then `run` afterwards
- I have configured this project to accept any login passwords if the username/email matches the database
